## Description

Control a cube and moves across the room by jumping from one platform to another. Don't forget to avoid the deadly lava. 

Brainstorm:

All variations happen in the same room.

Each variation you play a different character.

You start as the hero, trying to slay the monsters and finish the level?

Then, you become the monster, trying to survive the attack of the hero. (it replays a ghost of how you played as the hero) And maybe you try to kill the hero instead

Then, you become the clouds, just moving around, as a npc.

Then, you become the sun. And if you move off screen, the whole game becomes black, until you come back.

Then, you become the lava, and if you increase the flow of the lava, you can burn the hero.

Then, so many possibilities.
