# Starting points


**Frog eating flies but it gets harder and harder to catch them**

The frog's tongue moves like a snake game

you have to travel the snake through a maze and the fly appears at a random spot each time, making the game different through each playthrough.

The frog is poisonous

There is no way to win the game

You infect the flies every time you touch them

You are the villain of the game
