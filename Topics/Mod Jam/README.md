# Poisonous Frog

A game that consists of catching flies with your poisonous frog's tongue. You need to avoid the lily pads and catch as many flies as you can. 
But be careful, if you catch too many flies, you will contaminate the ecosystem and lose the game. Then, how could you win, if you are the problem?
