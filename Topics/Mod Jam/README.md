# Poisonous Frog

A game that consists of catching flies with your poisonous frog's tongue. You need to avoid the lily pads and catch as many fly as you can. 
But be careful, if you catch too many flies, you will contaminate the ecosystem and lose the game. Too bad. I guess you are the problem then,
since the only thing you can do is ruin a perfectly healthy ecosystem/
